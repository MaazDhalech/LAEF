          <h1 class="text-center">History of Pokemon</h1>
          <p class="par pt-3 mission-paragraph">Pokemon was created by Satoshi Tajiri, a Japanese inventor, and his
            illustrator friend Ken
            Sugimori.
            In 1982, Satoshi and his pals founded a gaming publication called Game Freak, but after a while, he chose to
            start developing his own video games rather than just writing about them.
            When Satoshi converted Game Freak into a gaming company in 1989, he and his friends produced a few
            successful titles like Pulseman, Yoshi, and Mario & Wario. When Satoshi converted Game Freak into a gaming
            firm in 1989, he and his friends produced a few successful titles like Pulseman, Yoshi, and Mario & Wario.

            Satoshi came up with the idea for Pocket Monsters (or as it is more popularly known, Pokémon) in the early
            1990s and pitched it to Nintendo. Satoshi was motivated by his childhood experiences exploring forests and
            discovering bugs and tadpoles.
            After some initial hesitation from Nintendo, Pocket Monsters was eventually approved, and Satoshi then spent
            the following six years working with legendary game designer Shigeru Miyamoto (the person responsible for
            Mario and The Legend of Zelda) to bring Pocket Monsters to life. In Japan, Pocket Monsters: Red and Green
            for the Gameboy was released on February 27, 1996.

            Players could trade Pokémon by connecting their Gameboys with each other via a connection to the
            cartridge-based games.

            The games eventually sold millions of copies and were launched in the UK and the US as Red and Blue versions
            in 1998. (instead of Green).

            Pokémon was used in place of Pocket Monsters as the name.

            Seven additional Pokémon game generations have since been released, starting with Gold and Silver and
            continuing with Ruby and Sapphire, Diamond and Pearl, Black and White, X and Y, Sun and Moon, and most
            recently Sword and Shield. More Pokémon were added to the games with each new generation; there are
            currently about 898 different species of Pokémon! (Therefore, catching them all will take a lot of time!)
            The Pokémon Trading Card Game was developed by a company called Media Factory following the initial games'
            success.

            On October 20, 1996, the first deck of cards with 102 cards and illustrations by Ken Sugimori, Mitsuhiro
            Arita, and Keiji Kinebuchi was made available.

            The cards quickly gained enormous popularity, and three years later, in 1999, Wizards of the Coast
            introduced them to North America. Subsequently, the rest of the world soon followed.

            Players could compete in Pokémon card tournaments that popped up, and there is currently a world
            championship tournament.

            More than 30 billion cards have been printed since then, and some buyers are even willing to pay hundreds of
            thousands of pounds for some of the more uncommon cards.

            <p>Pikachu that can generate powerful electricity have cheek sacs that are extra soft and super stretchy.
              When it smashes its opponents with its bolt- shaped tail, it delivers a surge of electricity equivalent to
              a lightning strike. Its Gigantamax power expanded, forming its supersized body and towering tail.</p>

            <p>Its wings can carry this Pokémon close to an altitude of 4,600 feet. It blows out fire at very high
              temperatures. It spits fire that is hot enough to melt boulders. It may cause forest fires by blowing

            <p>Due to being a Water-type, Greninja has control over water. It mainly uses this to compress water into
              weaponry, such as throwing stars, daggers, and katana blades. These water weapons it creates are sharp
              enough to cleave through metal.

            <p>This Pokémon's stomach is so strong, even eating moldy or rotten food will not affect it. It is not
              satisfied unless it eats over 880 pounds of food every day. When it is done eating, it goes promptly to
              sleep. Terrifyingly strong, this Pokémon is the size of a mountain—and moves about as much as one as well.
